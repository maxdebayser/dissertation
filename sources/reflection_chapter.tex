\begin{abstract}
Many object-oriented languages support some kind of runtime introspection that allows programmers to
navigate through meta-data describing the available classes, their attributes and methods. In general,
the meta-data can be used to instantiate new objects, manipulate their attributes and call their methods.
The meta-programming enabled by this kind of reflection has proven itself useful in a variety of applications
such as object-relational mappings and inversion-of-control containers and test automation

Motivated by the need of programmatic support for composition and configuration of software components
at runtime, in this work we show how to implement a runtime reflection support for \texttt{C++11}, using the available
runtime type information, template metaprogramming and source code analysis. We will show the capabilities
of the reflection \texttt{API} and the memory footprint for different kinds of meta-data.
The API relies on a few features introduced by C++11, the new ISO standard for C++.
Our reflection system is not invasive as it requires no modifications whatsoever of the application code.

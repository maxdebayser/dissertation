\abstract{%
Dependency injection, also known as Inversion of Control, is a way of structuring the configuration and composition of
software components that brings many benefits such as a loose coupling of components. However a generic dependency
injection framework requires runtime type introspection and this is why dependency injection is popular in Java and
almost non-existent in C++. In this work we present a reflection system for C++11 and show how to use it to improve
an implementation of the Service Component Architecture (SCA) for C++.

\abstract{%
Dependency injection, a form of inversion of control, is a way of structuring the configuration and composition of
software components that brings many benefits such as a loose coupling of components. However a generic dependency
injection framework requires runtime type introspection and this is why dependency injection is popular in \texttt{Java} and
almost non-existent in \texttt{C++}. In this work we present a reflection system for \texttt{C++11} and show how to use it to improve
an implementation of the Service Component Architecture (\texttt{SCA}) for \texttt{C++}. It uses several features of \texttt{C++11}
such as \emph{perfect forwarding}, \emph{variadic templates} and \emph{lvalue references} to improve usability and minimize overhead.
